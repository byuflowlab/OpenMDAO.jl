    get_rows_cols(; ss_sizes::Dict{Symbol, Int}, of_ss::AbstractVector{Symbol}, wrt_ss::AbstractVector{Symbol})

Get the non-zero row and column indices for a sparsity pattern defined by output subscripts `of_ss` and input subscripts `wrt_ss`.

`ss_sizes` is a `Dict` mapping the subscript symbols in `of_ss` and `wrt_ss` to the size of each dimension the subscript symbols correspond to.
The returned indices will be zero-based, which is what the OpenMDAO `declare_partials` method expects.

# Examples
Diagonal partials for 1D output and 1D input, both with length `5`:
```jldoctest; setup = :(using OpenMDAOCore: get_rows_cols)
julia> rows, cols = get_rows_cols(; ss_sizes=Dict(:i=>5), of_ss=[:i], wrt_ss=[:i])
([0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
```

1D output with length 2 depending on all elements of 1D input with length 3 (so not actually sparse).
```jldoctest; setup = :(using OpenMDAOCore: get_rows_cols)
julia> rows, cols = get_rows_cols(; ss_sizes=Dict(:i=>2, :j=>3), of_ss=[:i], wrt_ss=[:j])
([0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1], [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2])
```

2D output with size `(2, 3)` and 1D input with size `2`, where each `i` output row only depends on the `i` input element.
```jldoctest; setup = :(using OpenMDAOCore: get_rows_cols)
julia> rows, cols = get_rows_cols(; ss_sizes=Dict(:i=>2, :j=>3), of_ss=[:i, :j], wrt_ss=[:i])
([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1])
```

2D output with size `(2, 3)` and 1D input with size `3`, where each `j` output column only depends on the `j` input element.
```jldoctest; setup = :(using OpenMDAOCore: get_rows_cols)
julia> rows, cols = get_rows_cols(; ss_sizes=Dict(:i=>2, :j=>3), of_ss=[:i, :j], wrt_ss=[:j])
([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2])
```

2D output with size `(2, 3)` depending on input with size `(3, 2)`, where the output element at index `i, j` only depends on input element `j, i` (like a transpose operation).
```jldoctest; setup = :(using OpenMDAOCore: get_rows_cols)
julia> rows, cols = get_rows_cols(; ss_sizes=Dict(:i=>2, :j=>3), of_ss=[:i, :j], wrt_ss=[:j, :i])
([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5], [0, 2, 4, 1, 3, 5])
```

2D output with size `(2, 3)` depending on input with size `(3, 4)`, where output `y[:, j]` for each `j` depends on input `x[j, :]`.
```jldoctest; setup = :(using OpenMDAOCore: get_rows_cols)
julia> rows, cols = get_rows_cols(; ss_sizes=Dict(:i=>2, :j=>3, :k=>4), of_ss=[:i, :j], wrt_ss=[:j, :k]);

julia> @show rows cols;  # to prevent abbreviating the array display
rows = [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5]
cols = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11]
